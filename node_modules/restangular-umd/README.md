# Restangular UMD
> UMD supported build of Restangular

This repository is just a meta repo that pulls in [Restangular][restangular] strips off the first and last line of the `src/restangular.js` file and wraps it in UMD support. This allows us to use Restangular in [Webpack][webpack] or [Browserify][browserify].

## Usage:

To use this just `npm install restangular-umd` and then require it `restangular = require('restangular-umd')`.

This returns the module name, so you can just throw it into your dependencies array on your Angular module.

```js
const angular = require('angular')
const restangular = require('restangular-umd')

const app = angular.module('app', [restangular])
```
